# Today is Day 1 of Week 1 in your 7-day SQL challenge.

That means: We’re starting with basic-level SQL questions today.
You’ll progressively tackle more complex queries over the next 6 days using the same schema.
After Day 7, I’ll introduce a brand-new schema + question set aligned with a different real-world business context.

## Day 1 – Questions [Level: Basic, Foundation-Building] Lets Go
 I already uploaded dataset if you want to create your own data set with the Sql code,  go ahead and do it, i have already uploaded SQL code for that too. Although I already upload in csv file, so that you 
 can load it on your postgres or mysql or any other database management system.

## Using the schema (users, orders, products, order_items), solve the following:
- **Q1. Monthly User Signups**
Get the number of users who signed up each month in 2024.
Expected Output: Month | Year | Signups

- **Q2. User Order Count**
Return a list of users and how many total orders they placed.
Bonus: Also show users with zero orders.

- **Q3. Total Revenue by Category**
Calculate the total revenue for each product category.
Revenue = SUM(quantity * price) from order_items joined with products.

- **Q4. Top 5 Most Ordered Products**
Return the top 5 products by total quantity sold.

- **Q5. Daily Revenue Summary**
For each day in which any order was placed, show the total revenue earned.
